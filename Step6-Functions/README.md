# Functions
The updated compiler is now able to handle programs with multiple functions. Upon a function call, the caller saves all important registers on to the stack and jumps into the callee function after pushing the updated frame pointer on to the stack as well. All memory references are done with respect to the frame pointer's location on the stack. Memory references for function parameters are a positive offset of the frame pointer (represented by $n, where n is the offset). Memory references to local variables in the function are a negative offset of the frame pointer (represented by $-n, where n is the offset). The symbol table tree now includes additional information in every node that maintains this mapping of a variable to it's slot relative to the frame pointer. Each node also holds information identifying the type of variable (if it is a function parameter or a local variable in a function).
