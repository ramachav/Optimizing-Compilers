# Control Structures
Created a list of 3-address assembly code for control structures and combined it with the previously generated code for expressions. Looping constructs and logical statements can now be executed. The symbol tables and the object nodes were used to generate the code. The 3-address assembly code was used as an intermediate representation in order to generate Tiny assembly code that could be simulated.
